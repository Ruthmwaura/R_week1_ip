A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want 
to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from 
various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the 
same blog and collected data in the process. She wanted help in identifying 
which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

In this project I did EDA to determine individuals that are most likely to click cryptography 
course ads by a Kenyan entrepreneur. 

To successfully conduct this project I used CRISP DM;

-Business understanding
